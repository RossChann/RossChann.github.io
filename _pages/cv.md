Project and Experience
======
* Optimization in traffic signal recognition around NUS campus
  * Spring 2022   in [NUS](https://nus.edu.sg/)
  * An improved design of a software system capable of recognizing traffic light signals around the NUS campus was developed based on the Yolo image recognition model. My main work involved enhancing the graphic training process in the backend algorithm, employing unsupervised learning methods, and participating in optimization to achieve greater efficiency.

* Optimization in a specific dataset interaction back-end system
  * Optimizing the Application of User Training Data in Federated Learning Scenarios, Improving overall efficiency by adjusting the client training optimizer strategy in asynchronous FedAvg algorithm.
 
* Research on the efficiency enhancement of edge deep learning in data pre-classification
  * ongoing
  * United States
